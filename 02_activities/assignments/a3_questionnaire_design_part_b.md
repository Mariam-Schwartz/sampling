# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    write your answer here...
    ```
    The target population for my sample - current and recently departed entry and lower level employees -  aligns with the purpose of the survey. 
    The sampling frame - limiting to those who left six months ago, while practical runs the risk of excluding some people who may provide relevant insights. 
    Also it may be worthwhile to include mid and high level employees to get additional insights into the issues impacting all levels. 
    If turnover rates differ significantly by department, it will help to stratify by department to ensure adequate reprensentation across the organization  

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    write your answer here...
    ```

        1. How long have you been with the company?

        Less than 6 months
        6 months - 1 year
        1 to 2 years
        Over 2 years

        2. Did you voluntarily leave the company or are you considering leaving?

        Voluntarily left
        Considering leaving
        Not applicable

        3. What are the primary reasons you would consider leaving or have already left this company? (Select all that apply)

        Compensation
        Lack of career advancement opportunities
        Work-life balance
        Job stress
        Management style
        Lack of recognition or appreciation
        Discrimination or bias
        Other (please specify)

        4. Are you satisfied with the following aspects of your job? (Rate each on a 5-point scale: 
        Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied)

        Compensation
        Work-life balance
        Career growth opportunities
        Management and leadership
        Workplace culture

        5. How much do you agree with the following statement: "I feel a sense of belonging and inclusion within my team and the company."

        Strongly Agree
        Agree
        Neutral
        Disagree
        Strongly Disagree

        6. Have you experienced any specific challenges related to diversity, equity, and inclusion at the company?

        Yes (please specify)
        No

        7. How likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work to friends or family?

        Very Likely
        Likely
        Neutral
        Unlikely
        Very Unlikely

        8. What is one change you believe the company could make to better support you and your colleagues?

        9. (Optional) Please share any additional thoughts or experiences that you believe are relevant to understanding turnover.

Changes and Rationale: 

Added Question 2: "Did you voluntarily leave the company or are you considering leaving?"
This helps distinguish between current and former employees, enabling more tailored analysis of their perspectives.

Expanded Question 3: Added "Discrimination or bias" as an option for reasons for leaving.
Recognizing issues of discrimination or bias can uncover systemic challenges not addressed in the original survey.

Added Question 6: "Have you experienced any specific challenges related to diversity, equity, and inclusion?"
Addressing DEI issues aligns with ethical considerations of inclusivity and representation.

Expanded Question 9: Renamed the open-ended feedback section to emphasize relevance to understanding turnover.
This subtle rephrasing encourages more focused responses without limiting employee voice.

Ethics Improvements:Emphasized anonymity in the introduction (not shown here) and made the last question optional to reduce pressure on respondents.

Survey Structure Adjustments: Grouped related questions together (e.g., job satisfaction questions appear sequentially) to improve flow and reduce respondent fatigue.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    write your answer here...
    ```
    No, the purpose of the study could not be fulfilled by an observational study alone. 
    1. The survey seeks to capture employeesâ€™ perceptions, experiences, and motivations for leaving or considering leaving the company. These subjective factors, such as dissatisfaction with compensation, work-life balance, or management style, cannot be directly observed in behavior or workplace activities.
    2. Turnover is influenced by a range of internal (e.g., job satisfaction, team dynamics) and external (e.g., personal life circumstances, industry trends) factors. Many of these are not visible through observation.
    3. Surveys allow respondents to share insights on systemic issues like discrimination or lack of career advancement opportunities, which might not manifest overtly in observable behaviors or interactions.
